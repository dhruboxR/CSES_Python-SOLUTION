#  For a trailing zero, the number must contain a factor of 10.
#       { 10 = 2 × 5 } : So each pair (2, 5) produces one trailing zero.

#  In factorials, multiples of 2 : (every even number has a factor of 2).
    
#      So the number of 5s actually limits how many (2,5) pairs we can make.
#      Therefore, we only count multiples of 5.

#      5 → contributes one 5 → forms 1 pair (2×5) → 1 trailing zero
#      25 = 5² → contributes two 5s → forms 2 pairs → 2 trailing zeros
    
#  So higher powers of 5 contribute extra trailing zeros.
